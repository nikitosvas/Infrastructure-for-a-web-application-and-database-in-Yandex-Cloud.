**This configuration deploys a primary VPC and a public subnet for a group of load-balanced VMs, as well as a separate VPC and subnet for the PostgreSQL cluster. Security groups provide the necessary permissions for networking. The VMs are placed in a load-balanced group to ensure fault tolerance and load balancing. A PostgreSQL cluster is configured with a single host and a database accessible through the user.**
